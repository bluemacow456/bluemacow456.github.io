Welcome stanger!

My name is Luis Velasquez, and I am an aspiring writer, musician, and novice cyber security specialist living in the Los Angeles Area. 

This blog focuses on a variety topics but what you'll mostly find here are pieces relating to tech, life, and the human experience. Hope you enjoy and if you like what you see consider spreading the word and sharing these stories with others who may benefit :)
